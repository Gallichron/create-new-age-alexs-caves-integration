# Create: New Age / Alex's Caves Integration
Integrates similarly-themed features from Create: New Age and Alex's Caves so that they make more sense when used together.

## Features
- Made for Minecraft 1.20.1
- New Age's nuclear reactor produces the irradiated effect from Alex's Caves.
- New Age's nuclear reactor can use Uranium rods as fuel, and these will allow it to run 3x longer than thorium.
- The recipe for uranium rods has been replaced with sequenced crafting similar to the one used for nuclear fuel.
  - An intermediate product-- Incomplete Uranium Rod-- Has been added, and is radioactive in the player's inventory.

### Planned Features
- Alternative to New Age's "monkey mode" that uses Neodymium to create magnet blocks
