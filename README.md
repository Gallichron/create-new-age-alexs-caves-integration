# Create: New Age / Alex's Caves Integration
Integrates similarly-themed features from Create: New Age and Alex's Caves so that they make more sense when used together.

## Features
- Made for Minecraft 1.20.1
- New Age's nuclear reactor produces the irradiated effect from Alex's Caves.
- New Age's nuclear reactor can use Uranium rods as fuel, and these will allow it to run 3x longer than thorium.
- The recipe for uranium rods has been replaced with sequenced crafting similar to the one used for nuclear fuel.
  - An intermediate product-- Incomplete Uranium Rod-- Has been added, and is radioactive in the player's inventory.
- Replace recipes for redstone and netherite magnets with ones that require resources from the magnetic caves in order
  to use. (Works best with monkey mode).

Nothing else is planned for now; I imagine more configurability would be useful, and there's probably more room for
further integrations down the road, but for the purposes of my personal modpack, the changes here are sufficient.
